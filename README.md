A chess game seemed like the perfect way to demonstrate interacting with a 3D environment, as well as autonomous thinking and responses.This game is completely self-contained (i.e., no Internet connection required), and we think the opponent turned out to be competent yet fun!

- Created 3D models in Autodesk Maya and imported them into Unity
- Purchased audio from the Unity Asset Store and imported the clips into Unity
- Created a chess engine that evaluates moves based on material / position and chooses with Minimax
- Wired up the Unity game objects with the chess engine to create the finished product (View on GitHub)

Some items have been removed from the Assets folder to licensing.
